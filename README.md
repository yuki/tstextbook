# LaTeX book compilation

This repository is a test to compile a book make with LaTeX (and **tstextbook.cls**, obtained from [Typesetters](https://www.typesetters.se/latex-textbook-template/).

There's a workflow that compiles the book, creates a release and uploads the book into it when using tags into this repository. See [the workflow](.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml) to see how it works.
